<div class="hedline"><h1>Hands off  our islands</h1></div>
<div class="byline">By Katie Engelhart</div>
<p>The British government&rsquo;s latest military manoeuvre seems fresh out of a Monty Python sketch: 150 British soldiers who just returned from a tour in Afghanistan are being redeployed to the Falkland Islands, a land mass roughly the size of Connecticut, almost 13,000 km from Britain. </p>
<p>The saga began this month, when Argentine President Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner published a letter in two British newspapers staking her claim on the Falklands (the Malvinas, as they are known there), which are just off Argentina&rsquo;s coast. &ldquo;In a blatant exercise of 19th-century colonialism,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;Argentina was forcibly stripped of the Malvinas.&rdquo; Fern&aacute;ndez urged the UN to restore the islands&rsquo; &ldquo;territorial integrity.&rdquo; British Prime Minister </p>
<p>David Cameron didn&rsquo;t miss a beat, quickly appearing on the BBC to declare his &ldquo;extremely strong&rdquo; resolve to keep the islands British. Already, military chiefs have drawn up plans to prevent hostile action by Argentina, London&rsquo;s Telegraph reports.  </p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ve been here before. And memories of 1982 are certainly guiding Cameron&rsquo;s hand, says Graham Stewart, author of A History of Britain in the 1980s. That year, prime minister Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s firm action during the 10-week Falklands War&mdash;which cost 650 Argentine and 250 British lives&mdash;helped solidify her political support, and shape her legacy. &ldquo;Cameron is clearly aware of the legacy,&rdquo; says Stewart. </p>
<p>Most of the 3,000 Falklanders, who make their money in fishing and wool, &ldquo;feel firmly British,&rdquo; says Falklands MP Richard Sawle. Each year on June 14, Falklanders celebrate &ldquo;Liberation Day,&rdquo; the day in 1982 when British troops gave Argentina the boot. But Argentina has appeared increasingly belligerent on the issue&mdash;possibly due to the commercial quantities of oil that have recently been found around the islands. As tensions escalate, Falklanders are preparing for a March referendum on the matter of their territorial status. Falklands MP Barry Elsby anticipates &ldquo;at least 98 per cent&rdquo; will vote to remain British. In the meantime, in response to President Fern&aacute;ndez&rsquo;s entreaty, Britain&rsquo;s Sun published an ad in the Buenos Aires Herald, issuing a stern warning to Argentina: &ldquo;HANDS OFF!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="hedline"><h1>The great right hope </h1></div>
<div class="byline">By Michael Petrou</div>
<p>Naftali Bennett, a hawkish Israeli politician whose lightning-fast rise on the right has shaken up Israeli politics in the run-up to the country&rsquo;s Jan. 22 parliamentary election, campaigns with a hip and folksy charm that seems to soften the edges of his radical and illiberal ideas of how Israel should get along with Palestinians.  </p>
<p>Even former prime minister Ariel Sharon&mdash;&ldquo;the Bulldozer&rdquo;&mdash;eventually came around to the idea of Palestinian statehood. Current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has, too, though he&rsquo;s done little in practice to advance the proposition.  </p>
<p>Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home political party, doesn&rsquo;t bother with lip service. &ldquo;There are some things that most of us know will never happen,&rdquo; says one of his campaign ads. &ldquo;The Sopranos will not return for another season. Rami Kleinstein [a bald Israeli singer] will not grow an Afro. And a peace agreement with the Palestinians will not happen.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>This political pitch is narrated over video of an artist illustrating Bennett&rsquo;s arguments with whimsical and cartoonish pictures of maps and guns and oversized hair. It has the style of a smartphone commercial. And it suits Bennett, who is young, and who before entering politics made millions as a software tycoon.  </p>
<p>Under Bennett&rsquo;s &ldquo;stability initiative,&rdquo; Israel would formally annex about 60 per cent of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and offer citizenship or residency status to the approximately 48,000 Palestinians living there. Palestinians living in the remainder of the West Bank would be allowed some autonomy but not statehood.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s essentially a repackaged apartheid,&rdquo; says Brookings Institution fellow Khaled Elgindy, a former adviser to the Palestinian leadership on negotiations with Israel. &ldquo;Palestinians would still be stateless. It&rsquo;s not practicable from the standpoint of modern human rights. You cannot subjugate a people forever and simply say you have permanent autonomy but you can&rsquo;t be citizens. It&rsquo;s unworkable.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Current polls suggest the Jewish Home will win about 14 seats in Israel&rsquo;s 120-seat Knesset&mdash;possibly third place and strong enough to influence any governing coalition to which it belongs. Netanyahu will likely be re-elected as prime minister.  </p>
<p>Chances of a deal between Israel and the Palestinians would be sharply reduced by the presence of Bennett&rsquo;s party in a governing coalition, yet his stand on Palestinian statehood may not be the primary factor driving his popularity, says Dan Arbell, former deputy chief of mission at Israel&rsquo;s embassy in Washington. Bennett&rsquo;s youth and charisma have allowed him to connect with Israelis who aren&rsquo;t otherwise part of the national religious movement backing the Jewish settlement of the West Bank. </p>
<p>But for religious nationalists, Bennett&rsquo;s appeal is particularly strong&mdash;in part because he is so integrated in mainstream Israeli society. He&rsquo;s a business success story, served in an elite military unit, and lives in Israel proper, rather than an isolated hilltop settlement in the West Bank.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very much at the centre of Israeli life,&rdquo; says David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. &ldquo;A lot of religious Zionists resent that they&rsquo;ve been shoehorned in Israeli life&mdash;at least in the media&mdash;as settlers. They may not agree with all of his views. Some do. Some don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="hedline"><h1>Math geeks  to the rescue </h1></div>
<div class="byline">By Stephanie Findlay</div>
<p>A group of mathematicians, frustrated by South Africa&rsquo;s inability to stop rhino poaching, is creating an &ldquo;optimal management strategy&rdquo; to save the white rhinos. At an annual math conference, held last week at Johannesburg&rsquo;s University of the Witwatersrand, an international group of academics&mdash;from Oxford University to the Indian Institute of Technology&mdash;began work on the vexing problem. Though the government tightened hunting regulations in 2009 and deploys military aircraft to hunt poachers, poaching has only increased. Today, rhino horn, a prized medicinal ingredient in Asia, sells for $100,000 per kg.  </p>
<p>In designing the model, the value of a poacher&rsquo;s life, the cost of keeping a white rhino safe, and the worth of rhinos for tourism must be taken into account, says conservation economist Michael &rsquo;t Sas-Rolfes. Their recommendation, expected by year&rsquo;s end, may be controversial. Legalizing the rhino horn trade to reduce poaching is being considered. Ecologist Norman Owen-Smith believes a rhino policy recommendation based on numbers can help where military might and bunny-hugging platitudes have failed. &ldquo;Clear logic can help cut through emotion.&rdquo;</p>
