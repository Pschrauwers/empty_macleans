<div class="abstract">Seniors can still contribute, argues the author of a handbook on &lsquo;encore careers&rsquo;</div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">Who wants to play 30 years of golf anyway? </p>
<p>For people who have retired or been laid off, their later years can be some of the most fulfilling, especially since it&rsquo;s a time when the urge to make a contribution to the world is strong, and research shows older is better in many ways. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We become more empathetic, we get better at synthesizing ideas, making connections, solving complex problems,&rdquo; writes Marci Alboher, author of The Encore Career Handbook: How to Make a Living and a Difference in the Second Half of Life. In other words, older people can be less angry and better able to deal with disappointment than their younger peers.  </p>
<p>Alboher, 46, who was a lawyer before she switched to writing, believes that retirees are capable of making their mark well past their physical prime. As one expert in later-life achievement told her: &ldquo;You may forget where you put the keys, but you may be able to settle a major labour dispute.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the older set is often intimidated by the prospect of changing careers or working in an office populated by young colleagues. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to people who haven&rsquo;t written a resum&eacute; in 30 years, and for whom the thought of posting a profile, let alone a photo on [social media site] LinkedIn, is daunting, self-promotional, and just plain weird,&rdquo; she writes. </p>
<p>When choosing a second career, check in with yourself, she advises. What interested you 30 years ago may not interest you now. &ldquo;We all evolve over time. You may have fallen into your work for reasons of happenstance or due to pressures from your parents or partners.&rdquo; </p>
<p>One warning: if you&rsquo;ve worked for someone else your whole life, you may be tempted to choose a new path where you are your own boss. But think carefully about how much responsibility it will entail. &ldquo;What you are about to take on will be hard and demanding, and unless you are physically fit, you won&rsquo;t be able to perform at your best,&rdquo; 73-year-old career adviser Randal Charlton says in the book. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll have a drink on Friday night and maybe on Saturday, but never on Sunday,&rdquo; says Charlton. &ldquo;You have to be as fit as you can be. During the week I&rsquo;m in bed by 10.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The fields of education, counselling, coaching and health care are all excellent choices for older people. &ldquo;Many counselling roles may be emotionally difficult from time to time, but they don&rsquo;t usually require physical strength,&rdquo; Alboher writes. </p>
<p>Age discrimination is real, however, so be prepared. &ldquo;Many employers are concerned that older employees won&rsquo;t want to learn new things or will have outdated technology skills.&rdquo; Emphasize your experience and ensure your computer skills are up to snuff, she suggests. Take a proper course; don&rsquo;t rely on a relative to show you how PowerPoint works. </p>
<p>One way to demonstrate you are technologically savvy and comfortable with social media is to have a great LinkedIn profile. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to post your picture, grey hair and all, Alboher says. &ldquo;When an interviewer finds a profile with no photo, it can suggest that the person isn&rsquo;t really plugged in.&rdquo; A photo makes it easier for people to remember you, too. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fret about the dates on your resum&eacute;, but don&rsquo;t omit your age, either. One expert in the book says it&rsquo;s a red flag. &ldquo;I end up assuming more years are missing than not, which just makes you appear older.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In a job interview, expect to be asked the are-you-too-old-for-us question. An employer may say, &ldquo;Most of the people here are under 30 and communicate largely by text and instant messaging.&rdquo; Prepare your answer, Alboher writes in the book. Say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much to learn from young people and I hope they&rsquo;ll see they can learn from me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>An interviewer may also ask what you see yourself doing in five years, as a way of expressing concern that you might retire any minute. Say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned how hard it is to predict where one will be in the future, but I understand myself and my priorities. I want to have a purpose. I want to learn from my friends and colleagues. I want to give back.&rdquo;
