<h3>THE LOST CARVING: A JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF MAKING </h3>
<span>David Esterly </span>
</div></a></dt>
<p>The wonderfully named Grinling Gibbons, whose 17th-century woodcarved masterpieces of flowers, fruits and foliage can be seen in London churches and stately homes across the British countryside, is something of a folk hero to the English, one of the few artists of his time and medium whose name is still remembered today. David Esterly, on the other hand, is an American carver, once a Fulbright scholar who was in Britain researching his doctoral thesis on Yeats, when he encountered a Gibbons carving. In that moment of &ldquo;conversion,&rdquo; Esterley writes, he suddenly saw &ldquo;in a way that I&rsquo;d never seen anything before.&rdquo; It led to an overpowering desire to unite mind and hand in his life&rsquo;s work. Gibbons&rsquo;s work &ldquo;was saying something that couldn&rsquo;t be said in any other way, and it wasn&rsquo;t saying it to the intellect.&rdquo; </p>
<p>After more than a decade of learning his craft, and struggling under Gibbons&rsquo;s large shadow, Esterly was tapped, in the aftermath of the devastating Hampton Court Palace fire of 1986 (and in the teeth of British xenophobia) to replace a destroyed Gibbons carving, a long pendant of flowers and leaves over a door in one of the king&rsquo;s apartments. A quarter-century later, Esterly opened for the first time the journal he kept during the project and revisited one of the crucial years of his life. The result, <em>The Lost Carving</em>, is beautifully written and hauntingly evocative, a graceful meditation on art and craft, the singular life and achievements of Gibbons, and the ties that bind us to the past.  </p>
<p>The year&rsquo;s effort, filled with moments of intense frustration&mdash;as Esterly tried to work out how Gibbons had accomplished some of his greatest effects&mdash;and intense happiness when the work and the wood flowed in his hands, freed the carver from his long-dead mentor. The more Esterly plunged into the carving, the more Gibbons faded from it. &ldquo;In the end there was no ghost to lay. Gibbons wasn&rsquo;t the giant whose shoulder I was riding on. The giant was the act of carving, the making of anything.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE LAST REFUGE: YEMEN, AL-QAEDA, AND AMERICA&rsquo;S WAR IN ARABIA  </h3>
<span>Gregory D. Johnsen </span>
</div></a></dt>
<p>Al-Qaeda did not die with Osama bin Laden. The militant Islamist group continues to thrive in Yemen, a corridor of desert and tribes abutting Saudi Arabia in the south of the Arabian peninsula. Johnsen tracks al-Qaeda in Yemen from the 1980s to the present in authoritative, often stunning detail. We learn about how the organization has managed to recruit and persist despite the best efforts of the U.S. and the frequently co-operative Yemeni regime. A decentralized structure of compartmentalized cells has orchestrated a steady stream of attacks against Americans, tourists, the oil industry and Yemeni &ldquo;collaborators.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>The U.S. found a sometimes ally in Yemen&rsquo;s then-president, Ali Abdullah Salih, who released many jihadis in 2003-04 in a failed reintegration program, and who tended to ignore al-Qaeda during civil wars in the country&rsquo;s north. But the big picture is a persistent American failure to come to grips with the extent and nature of the threat. Al-Qaeda has grown in Yemen despite the blowback it faced for attacks that mostly claimed the lives of Muslim Yemenis. Johnsen suggests that many U.S. policies, including an expanded bombing campaign by unmanned drones, have made things worse. The bombings kill many&mdash;and recruit more. As one Yemeni tribal leader put it: &ldquo;The U.S. sees al-Qaeda as terrorism, and we consider the drones terrorism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Johnsen lets his narrative of events speak for itself, but his account would have benefited from a more detailed assessment of American foreign policy. Johnsen makes no prescriptions and offers no conclusions. The story ends in the ominous present, with the United States increasing its military involvement in Yemen&rsquo;s civil war, and al-Qaeda seeming stronger than ever. This is the story of a hydra, resilient despite filling a graveyard with its heads.</p>

<h3>ON WHEELS: FIVE EASY PIECES </h3>
<span>Michael Holroyd </span>
</div></a></dt>
<p>A heavyweight literary biographer (<em>Augustus John, Bernard Shaw</em>) and husband to novelist Margaret Drabble, Sir Michael Holroyd is 77 now, but is at pains to note his newest book is not his last. &ldquo;I have already written that,&rdquo; he declares in<em> On Wheels</em>, either because he has that volume, whatever it may be, tucked into his solicitor&rsquo;s safe, or because he believes this odd and oddly charming collection of car-related reminiscences is too much of a trifle to be called a &ldquo;book.&rdquo; No matter. From Holroyd&rsquo;s observation that cars and motorcycles were the smartphones and computers of the early 20th century&mdash;mystically liberating objects truly understood only by the young&mdash;to his description of Welsh painter Augustus John, who had had but a single driving lesson, motoring from London to Dorset, unable to get out of first gear, <em>On Wheels</em> is more than bookish enough. </p>
<p>For all his interest in cars&mdash;as a child Holroyd spent hours playing in the never-used Ford parked in his grandparents&rsquo; garage&mdash;he was no natural driver. He couldn&rsquo;t understand how all the cars on the road generally managed to miss each other, an ongoing matter of luck that he believed was bound to end if ever he was put behind the wheel. But faced with a girlfriend tired of driving him around, Holroyd gritted his way through lessons, and later successfully taught Drabble, another motoring klutz. Drabble was so impressed with his lessons, she told the <em>Daily Mail, </em>&ldquo;Michael is wasted on biography.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But family lore pales before <em>On Wheels&rsquo;</em> real gems, the nuggets of social history unearthed in Holroyd&rsquo;s earlier research. There are snippets from the lives of Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West, and John&rsquo;s epic journey along (thankfully) empty 1911 roads to Dorset, during which he hit, miraculously, only a barrel organ. And in a nod to the flip side of automotive liberation, he tells the poignant story of how Shaw, an admirer of brute force and of Lawrence of Arabia, gave his friend the powerful motorcycle that cost Lawrence his life.</p>

<h3>TRENT: WHAT HAPPENED  AT THE COUNCIL </h3>
<span>John W. O&rsquo;Malley </span>
</div></a></dt>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church council in Trent, Italy, which concluded 450 years ago, has always been recognized as a key event in the cultural and religious history of Europe. A bogeyman to many contemporary Protestants dismayed by the Church&rsquo;s successful rally against the tide of reformed Christianity, Trent has almost as many detractors among Catholics. For every traditionalist who believes Trent kept the Church strong until it was lamentably weakened by Vatican II, there is a liberal Catholic who believes precisely the opposite. The Tridentine mass, the uniform Latin rite extended to the entire Church by Trent, remains a large bone of contention. </p>
<p>For all that, argues O&rsquo;Malley, a Jesuit and prominent historian at Washington&rsquo;s Georgetown University, what actually happened at Trent&mdash;and brought five popes, two Holy Roman emperors and other European monarchs repeatedly to the brink of disaster&mdash;remains little known. O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s take is enlivened by the way he refuses to neglect the mundane details for the high theological debates. Trent was a small town, which struggled mightily to house and feed the attendees, in an era when an important cardinal travelled with a retinue of 150 and their even more numerous horses. The broiling summers stoked the tempers of the northerners, while Spaniards and southern Italians were appalled by the winter snowdrifts. The town was a hard three-day ride from Rome, not far enough to safely ignore frantic papal instructions, but far enough to cause frequent delays while the dispatch riders whipped their horses, sparking one delegate&rsquo;s sardonic observation that, unlike previous councils where the Holy Spirit descended on bishops from on high, at Trent, he arrived via the papal mailbag. </p>
<p>Complicating everything was the fact that the popes were both spiritual leaders and temporal powers, monarchs with armed forces, prisons and courts, who needed money every bit as much as rival kings did. The popes were far more open to doctrinal than financial reform. O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s lively narrative shows how so much was accomplished despite the chaos and difficulties: Trent, even when it didn&rsquo;t enact legislation itself, set Catholicism on the road to reforming its late medieval abuses.</p>

<h3>THE VIOLIN: A SOCIAL  HISTORY OF THE WORLD&rsquo;S MOST VERSATILE INSTRUMENT </h3>
<span>David Schoenbaum </span>
</div></a></dt>
<p>The violin is the world&rsquo;s premier musical instrument. A box with some strings, and a stick to slide across them, has become an art object, a cultural symbol and the undisputed leader of the symphony orchestra. Now Schoenbaum devotes a massive book to what he calls &ldquo;the power of the bowed string,&rdquo; displaying equal knowledge of the musical and business aspects of the instrument: what it takes to produce a beautiful sound is covered, but so is the economic climate during the years when violin-making began&mdash;years that, Schoenbaum notes happily, &ldquo;coincide with the introduction of printing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Schoenbaum has divided <em>The Violin</em> into four sub-books. &ldquo;Making It&rdquo; is about the craftsmen of the instruments, including legendary ones like Antonio Stradivari. In &ldquo;Selling It,&rdquo; we learn about the prices people will pay to get a good violin and about the people who have counterfeited or stolen them. (&ldquo;Upper-end violins,&rdquo; Schoenbaum points out, are &ldquo;easy to hide, disguise and turn into cash.&rdquo;) &ldquo;Playing It&rdquo; is about violinists through the ages, and finally we get &ldquo;Imagining It,&rdquo; a rundown of violin images in high and popular culture, from Marc Chagall&rsquo;s famous fiddler on the roof to a bunch of cheesy Hollywood movies starring Jascha Heifetz. </p>
<p>Because of the loose structure of each section, it can be hard to figure out if there&rsquo;s an overall point being made, or if we&rsquo;re just reading a collection of amusing or interesting violin-related stories: Schoenbaum puts in just about everything he can think of that relates to the instrument, even the full text of an obscure Gershwin song about Russian fiddlers. But in the end, the pileup of detail creates the same dizzying impact as a good violinist; after following the fiddle through all these different people, countries and classes, we have to agree with Schoenbaum that &ldquo;the solo violin exercised a gravitational pull no other instrument or combination of instruments could match.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>C&Eacute;ZANNE: A LIFE </h3>
<span>Alex Danchev </span>
</div></a></dt>
<p>There is one pressing question when considering a freshly printed tome on the legendary Paul C&eacute;zanne. Is there enough new information to justify a comprehensive assessment of the French painter who is often called the father of modern art? Surprisingly, yes. Much has been written about him, but not in the last few decades. This new book by author and academic Danchev is a thoughtful study of the existing primary source material, plus an aggregate of quotes from important artists, philosophers and writers who&rsquo;ve had a &ldquo;C&eacute;zanne epiphany.&rdquo; By showing how C&eacute;zanne influenced others&mdash;such as Seamus Heaney, Freud, Rilke and Canadian artist Michael Snow&mdash;Danchev adds considerably to our understanding of the artist and his impact. </p>
<p>Danchev debunks the caricature of C&eacute;zanne as a stock figure of derision, &ldquo;part clown, part vagrant, part bumpkin.&rdquo; In reality, C&eacute;zanne was the kind of classically educated person who could interrupt a lecture on Virgil to correct the speaker and recite passages from memory. The author tackles several other myths: that the artist&rsquo;s father kept him exiled in Aix in the 1860s; that C&eacute;zanne was sexually uncomfortable with nude models; that he and &Eacute;mile Zola had a falling-out later in life; that his wife, Hortense, was uninvolved in his work; that he was demented at the end of his life. Now we know better. </p>
<p>Readers may grow weary of digesting lengthy passages that refer to C&eacute;zanne only indirectly. Some quotes feel twice removed, like excerpts from Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s biography of art critic Roger Fry. There is Baudelaire on beauty. There are elaborate literary parallels between C&eacute;zanne and protagonists in works by Beckett, Kafka, Balzac and, more directly, Zola. Danchev makes guesses about Hortense by examining Voltaire&rsquo;s paramour. He suggests that C&eacute;zanne&rsquo;s feelings about his father could mirror Kafka&rsquo;s. (Sure, maybe.) But Danchev earns the right to his conjectures by his exhaustive research and probing analysis of C&eacute;zanne&rsquo;s portraits and landscapes&mdash;the best stuff in the book by far.</p>
