<p>When the Conservative government unveiled a $400-million five-year fund to help provinces recruit police officers in 2008, it was billed as a key part of Prime Minister Stephen Harper&rsquo;s law-and-order agenda. Former public safety minister Peter Van Loan told the House the following year the new officers were necessary after more than a decade of Liberal failure to take crime seriously. And in Quebec, at least, the money went to fund anti-gang and cybercrime squads&mdash;with the latter playing a key role in hunting down Luka Magnotta, the man accused of killing and dismembering a Chinese student in Montreal and posting a video of the alleged crime online. </p>
<p>Now, with the agenda in Ottawa focused squarely on austerity, and the funding for the program due to run out soon, the future of the police officer recruitment fund is becoming just the latest point of tension between the Harper Tories and Quebec. </p>
<p>Funding for the recruitment program is set to expire at the end of March. Several municipal and provincial leaders, including Quebec Premier Pauline Marois, have called on the federal government to renew it. But the federal government has repeatedly said that if the provinces want to keep the 2,500 officers nationwide that the fund covered, they&rsquo;ll have to pony up the cash themselves.  </p>
<p>In many provinces the end of the program is raising concerns. But given the state of Quebec-Ottawa relations, the fund&rsquo;s fate is proving to be powerful sovereignist fodder. St&eacute;phane Bergeron, the province&rsquo;s public safety minister, warns the move will heavily impact Quebec&rsquo;s law-enforcement efforts. In November the national assembly voted unanimously on a motion Bergeron introduced demanding Ottawa renew the fund. Quebec may also be getting ready to replace some or all of Ottawa&rsquo;s funding, which totalled $92 million. While a spokesperson for Bergeron said the government will wait until the March deadline to decide what to do, rumours are that the PQ is strongly considering kicking in the money. Such a move by Marois would support the sovereignist narrative that the federal government is shirking its responsibility in Quebec&mdash;the Parti Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois government picked a similar fight last year over the government&rsquo;s axing of the long-gun registry, which Quebec plans to resurrect. </p>
<p>Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois MP Maria Mourani, an author and expert on Montreal&rsquo;s crime underworld, says the fight against organized crime is at risk. Provinces were free to spend their share of the fund as they wished, and of the sum Quebec received, $38 million went to staffing a 46-person anti-gang &ldquo;Eclipse squad&rdquo; in Montreal. Mourani says a recent spike in gang murders makes the squad more critical than ever. Mourani notes Montreal police also dedicated more resources to a cybercrime unit, which has been critical in fighting child exploitation online and helped track Magnotta&rsquo;s digital footprint.  </p>
<p>Julie Carmichael, director of communications for the public safety minister, points to the Harper government&rsquo;s efforts to stiffen sentencing for organized crime. But this has failed to satisfy critics. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s incoherent,&rdquo; says Mourani. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in favour of law and order, but they won&rsquo;t fund it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>British Columbia: The Vancouver Canucks are ready to hit the ice, but they have a way to go to get their fans back. A poll by Insights West found that hockey support in B.C. dropped by nearly half over the course of the NHL lockout, while those who say they are not much of a fan or not a fan at all jumped from 14 per cent to 42 per cent. The poll&rsquo;s accuracy will soon be put to the test.  </p>
<p>Saskatchewan: When it comes to celebrating Canada&rsquo;s 150th birthday in 2017, leave the party planning to the people, say people in the prairie province. Nearly 70 per cent of residents from Saskatchewan agreed that ordinary citizens and not government should be planning Canada&rsquo;s sesquicentennial festivities. Three in five Canadians feel the same way.  </p>
<p>Ontario: Surprise, surprise. Falling chunks of concrete from Toronto&rsquo;s crumbling Gardiner Expressway are not inspiring a sense of security among drivers. Half of the city&rsquo;s residents&mdash;and 61 per cent of women&mdash;believe the Gardiner is dangerous, according to a Forum Research poll released last month. But despite their safety concerns, respondents were divided about what to do about it. One-quarter want it repaired, while 27 per cent want it torn down and replaced with a tunnelled roadway.   </p>
<p>Quebec: Quebecers have a case of the winter blues when it comes to Canada&rsquo;s job market, according to a Bank of Montreal survey. Barely more than one-quarter of people in the province who took the survey said they were optimistic about improved hiring rates for the coming year, well below the 38 per cent average for all of Canada.  </p>
<p>Atlantic Canada: People in the Atlantic provinces are the biggest opponents of Canadian companies being sold to foreign state-owned enterprises. According to a recent poll by Ipsos Reid, 80 per cent of people in the region believe such deals should be prohibited, compared to 74 per cent for the country as a whole.</p>

<p>Liberal leadership fatigue syndrome? </p>
<p>With a federal Liberal leadership campaign happening at the same time as the Ontario Liberal leadership, some Liberals are worried about leadership fatigue syndrome setting in and the fact they would be going to the same troughs to raise funds. Federal Liberal leadership contender Martha Hall Findlay says she has encountered many people who have been inundated by robocalls asking for donations to the provincial leadership campaigns. However, Hall Findlay says all these campaigns are overall a good thing, because &ldquo;you have a whole lot of people and a whole lot of engaged Liberals.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She has decided to go for shorter hair for this leadership campaign, with the help of Ernesto Domanico at Salon Solis in Toronto. She says she has not had short hair in over 25 years and had a bit of a complex about it. Liberal leadership candidate Justin Trudeau has also opted for shorter hair, prompting this from Hall Findlay: &ldquo;I think he has gone shorter than I have.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Former Liberal MP Gerard Kennedy, who ran in the 2006 federal Liberal leadership race, is currently running in the Ontario provincial race. A twist is that this time around Kennedy is being praised for his French, compared to all the other candidates. In 2006 he was often attacked for his poor French. He says his decision not to run again federally was because he wanted to be close to his children, who both go to French school in Toronto. He says being home with his 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter is what has helped improve his French. </p>
<p>Idle No More fills Facebook inbox </p>
<p>Idle No More is a big issue in the Manitoba riding of Churchill, represented by NDP MP Niki Ashton. She says her riding has 33 communities of First Nations people, from one of which hails Raymond Robinson, who joined Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence in her hunger strike the day after she began hers. Ashton says that around 65 per cent of her riding is Aboriginal. Ashton, who was first elected in 2008, says of Idle No More, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. It&rsquo;s led by young people.&rdquo; For Ashton, 30, that means people with whom she has worked and gone to school are helping to spearhead the movement: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t talk about bills often, especially with people my age.&rdquo; The Conservative government&rsquo;s omnibus legislation is at the heart of the protests and Ashton says much time is being spent explaining it&mdash;mostly over Facebook. Most protest movements or issue-based activism send MPs form emails, but Ashton says Idle No More has resulted in her Facebook inbox being inundated with real, individual messages. When asked if she has read the whole omnibus bill, she says she has read sections of the hundreds of pages but mostly relies on the notes the NDP has provided, breaking it all down.</p>

<p>Over the last year, by some estimates, roughly 50 dogs have gone missing in southeastern Manitoba, sparking fears there is a dognapping network at work. And while the RCMP insist there is no evidence to support this claim, locals are becoming increasingly convinced the animals are being used as &ldquo;bait&rdquo; dogs to train other dogs to fight.  </p>
<p>Many of the dogs disappeared when they were on private property. One resident of Aubin, Man., told the Winnipeg Free Press he found tire tracks and a dog biscuit near his property, but because he had an invisible electric fence, his dog was not lured away. Others have not been so lucky. Last week the skinned remains of a dog were found beside a rural highway propped up in the snow. Owners have formed a Facebook group to share their stories. </p>
<p>But even if police discover the pets were stolen for dogfighting, there may not be much they can do. Under the federal Criminal Code, only those who are shown to be &ldquo;wilfully neglecting&rdquo; animals can be charged with animal cruelty. In Manitoba, it is illegal to make animals fight each other, but what constitutes participation in a dogfight isn&rsquo;t clear, making the crime hard to prosecute.</p>
